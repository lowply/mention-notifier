# Mention Notifier

~~A GitHub Action that notifies you on Slack when you're mentioned on GitHub.~~

Using GitHub Actions as a mean of sending notifications doesn't seem to be a good idea, so I will reconsier the design of this tool. I've delisted this actions from the GitHub Marketplace. Stay tuned for more updates.

In the meanwhile, try [GitHub Mobile](https://github.com/mobile/) if you'd like to get notified @mentions on your mobile device. This tool will focus on sending notifications to Slack channels.
